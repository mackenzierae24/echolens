I've been really seeking God's heart on this decision, and I feel like He's been preparing me for this season of life. It's all about walking in obedience and trusting His timing, even when it doesn't make sense from a worldly perspective. My pastor always says we need to be kingdom-minded in everything we do.

I'm called to be a servant leader in my community, to shine His light wherever He places me. Prayer has been so central to this journey - I'm learning to surrender my plans and embrace His will. There's such peace that comes from knowing you're walking in your God-given purpose and using your gifts for His glory.
