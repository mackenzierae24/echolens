I'm really trying to hold space for my authentic self right now, you know? Like, I've been doing this deep inner work and I can feel my vibration shifting. My energy healer says I'm finally in alignment with my true purpose. I've been manifesting this new chapter for months, and I can literally feel the universe conspiring to help me. 

It's all about staying present and trusting the process. I'm learning to release what doesn't serve me and lean into love. My meditation practice has been so profound lately - I'm accessing these higher frequencies that just feel so expansive. I know I'm exactly where I need to be on my journey.
